# Specter Financing | Accounting And Finance Website

## This was a website created by Hashmat Ibrahimi utilizing flex-box for a fake Accounting company named Specter Financing 

## __First__
#### Open the site using the index.html file found in the root directory

### We start off with the splash screen with a navbar on top and the showcase under it as presented below

![Showcase](/img/readme/showcase.jpg);

- The navigations up top do not redirect to a different page but scrolls down
- The button in the center screen scrolls down to the what section with the help of javaScript

![What](/img/readme/what.jpg);

- The nav bar up top has now become more transparent based on the scroll number
- This section utilizes Font Awesome icons and a Lorem junk text to fill space
- The site utilized Flex-Box with every element to create a fluid yet simple page

![who](/img/readme/who.jpg);

- This section represents what the company is about and again using Lorem Ipsum as a way to fill white space
- Using flex column i was able to split the section in two with the left being the image and the right having words
- with flex box i was able to get equal spacing and sizing without trial and error


![Clients](/img/readme/clients.jpg);

- The clients are custom made logos and will appear or disappear depending on the width of the screen
- This section was the most difficult as the icons were set at a specific height and columns couldn't be added without modify the html



![Contact](/img/readme/contact.jpg);

- on the left is a contact form
- on the right utilizes google maps api to display a location of the "Company"
- The footer is set to present a corporate-esk feel with its copyright
